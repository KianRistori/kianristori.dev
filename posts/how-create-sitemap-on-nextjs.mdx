## Some new stuff

**Hey everyone!** Recently, I've made some changes to this blog. On May 18, 2022, I implemented some new features, such as **highlighting** and **animations** in the Hero section, as well as a new About Me page with a Timeline of my important milestones.

However, I had forgotten something really important for Google SEO: the **Sitemap**. So, I researched some tutorials to implement it, but with no success.

So Iâ€™m here to do (hopefully) a great tutorial on How create sitemap on NextJS, in my case for a blog to index the post.

### Install ****next-sitemap****

The first step is to install [next-sitemap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-sitemap#installation) using the command:

```
npm i next-sitemap
```

Once complete, create a basic configuration file in the root of your project. Ensure the file is named `next-sitemap.config.js`. Copy the following code into the file:

```js title="next-sitemap.config.js" showLineNumbers
/** @type {import('next-sitemap').IConfig} */
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: process.env.SITE_URL
  generateRobotsTxt: true,
}
```

### Building

Now in your `package.json` add this command under the **********build********** script:

```json title="package.json" {2}
{
  "build": "next build",
  "postbuild": "next-sitemap"
}
```

### Env file

Now, in your `.env` file, add your `SITE_URL` variable. Ensure that you include the full domain name in the `SITE_URL`, as Google Search Console requires the absolute domain. For example:

```bash title=".env" {1}
SITE_URL=https://www.kianristori.dev/
```

With this, Google Search Console works well. You can now view your sitemap at `domain/sitemap.xml` and add it to Google Search Console to improve your SEO.

Bye for now!

**Kian**
