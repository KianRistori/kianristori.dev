# Hi Everyone 👋🏻

## I'm Kian 🚀

### Full Stack Web Developer

In this first **Post** I introduce

1. Why I have create this Website
2. Why I use it
3. The Future Projects

## Why I have create this Website?

I don't really know why I created this Website but i need a place where i can share my projects with the world 🌏

Every day I make little projects utils or not and I will show you: what they do, why I have created that,improved or add more functionality.

## Why I use it

I use it to improve my English vocabulary and writing skills, I think write this things is a great exercise. In the other side I can improve my IT language for projects team work.

## The Future Projects

For the future I don't have a plan, this site is a test and I'll see what happens. Maybe I can upgrade with some optimization and so on.

**Thanks for the moment**
