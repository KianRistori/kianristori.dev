# To Start

# NextJS

## Why NextJS?
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source web development framework built on top of **Node.js** enabling **React** based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

It's used to build a complete web application with **React** from scratch.

## The firts step is create the NextJS App

```console
npx create-next-app@latest name-app
```

Now you have create the new directory called **name-app**. Move into it:

```console
cd name-app
```

To run the app following this command:

```console
npm run dev
```

Let’s check to see if it’s working. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) from your browser.

## Welcome to NextJS

## Editing the Page

Now you can edit the page of website starting from the **index.js**, and change everything **HTML** code

## Tailwind CSS

For the styling of website I have use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes. To install follow this comand:

```console
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

This code create the file *tailwind.config.js*, add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Add the **@tailwind** directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your *./styles/globals.css* file.

```javascript
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Now you can start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.

```javascript
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Hello world!
    </h1>
  )
}
```

## MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a superset of markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity, and embed components within your content, helping you to bring your pages to life.

Next.js supports MDX through a number of different means, this page will outline some of the ways you can begin integrating MDX into your Next.js project.

Setup `@next/mdx` in NextJS following this code

```console
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
```

In your *next.config.js* copy this code to use MDX

```javascript
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [],
  },
})
module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
})
```

Create a new MDX page within the `/pages` directory:

```console
- /pages
  - my-mdx-page.mdx
- package.json
```

Now you can use the markdown in the file **.mdx**

## Deploy

To deploy my website I have used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), I have connected my Github repository and Vercel host my website.

## Custom Domain

For the domain I have used [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), in Vercel I have take the DNS and in Namecheap I have added it, waiting few minutes for the Vercel controll. If Vercel pass the control your website have a custom domain.
